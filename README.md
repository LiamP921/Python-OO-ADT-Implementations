# Object-Orientated Abstract Data Types
Object-orientated implementations of various abstract data types in Python!

These are:

- Linear Queue

- Circular Queue

- Priority Queue (utilising a heap to maintain logical element order via heap rules)

- Linked List (w/ double linking for bi-directional node traversal and, therefore 'O(1)' TC for the 'addNode', 'addNodeAt' and 'deleteNode' methods)

- Stack

- Hash Table (utilising the Murmur3 hashing algorithm for formulating deterministic hash indexes that minimise collision rate)

- Graph (utilising an adjacency list for either directed or undirected graphs, w/ depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods, as well as Dijsktra's algorithm)

- Binary Search Tree (w/ in, pre, and post-order traversal methods, as well as a balancing method)

- Vector (w/ Graham Scan to compute the convex hull created by a list of instances, which can then be displayed via matplotlib functions)
